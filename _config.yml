name: James J. Kim
tagline: MS in CS @ Cornell University
career-objective: | 
  I'm a [MS student](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/ms) in Computer Science at [Cornell](https://cs.cornell.edu/), broadly interested in building sample-efficient AI Agents to accelerate scientific discovery and streamline research workflows with Prof. [Jennifer Sun](https://jenjsun.com/).

  In a previous life, I developed computational models of brain-behavior dynamics in substance use addiction with Prof. Amy Kuceyeski in the [CoCo Lab](https://www.cocolaboratory.com/), and worked on real-time acoustic sensing for hand pose tracking in wearable tech with Prof. Cheng Zhang in the [SciFi Lab](https://www.scifilab.org/). 

  Feel free to reach out— happy to chat!
